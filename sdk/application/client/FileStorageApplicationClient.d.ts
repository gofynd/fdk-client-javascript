     * Start
     * Upload
     * Complete

     * Initiates the assets upload using `startUpload`.

     *
     * ### Upload
     * Use the storage link to upload a file (Buffer or Blob) to the File Storage.
     * Make a `PUT` request on storage link received from `startUpload` API with the file (Buffer or Blob) in the request body.
     *
     * ### Complete
     * After successfully upload, call the `completeUpload` API to finish the upload process.
     * This operation will return the URL of the uploaded file.
